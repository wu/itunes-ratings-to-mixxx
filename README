This script will only work on macOS.  It reads the ratings from your
itunes library using applescript, and applies them to mixxx using the
sqlite database.

To install the script dependencies, it's recommended that you install
Carton, and use it to install the dependencies defined in the
cpanfile.

  cpanm Carton
  carton install

  # no arguments required
  carton exec ./mixxx-ratings

Use the DRYRUN environment variable to display what would be done
without actually making any changes to the database.

  DRYRUN=1 ./mixxx-ratings

Set the DEBUG environment variable for more information.

  DEBUG=1 ./mixx-ratings
